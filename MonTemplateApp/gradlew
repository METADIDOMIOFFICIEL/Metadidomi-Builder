#   Gradle start up script for POSIX generated by Gradle.
#
#   Important for running:
#
#   (1) You need a POSIX-compliant shell to run this script. If your /bin/sh does
#       not find it, but you have some other /bin/sh shell, you may want to alter
#       the first line to use that instead.
#
#   (2) Gradle will search in your home directory for a ".gradle" folder (by default).
#       For more detail about location of the gradle user home folder, see
#       https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/command_line_interface.html#sec:command_line_execution
